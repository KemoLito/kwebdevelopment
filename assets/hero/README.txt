Hero background media for homepage (index.html)
=============================================

Place your files here so the hero section can show a video or image background.

REQUIRED FILES (create these for the hero to use them):

1. hero.mp4
   - Video that plays behind the hero on the homepage.
   - Recommended: 5–10 seconds, looping, muted.
   - Format: H.264/MP4 (best compatibility).
   - Resolution: 1920×1080 (1080p) or 1280×720. Avoid huge files.
   - Content idea: subtle screen/code/build visuals so visitors instantly
     understand "website development/creation" (e.g. code, browser, design).
   - Keep it professional and not distracting.

2. hero.jpg
   - Poster/fallback image.
   - Shown while the video is loading and when the user has
     "prefers-reduced-motion" (no autoplay video).
   - Same aspect ratio as the video (e.g. 1920×1080 or 16:9).
   - Can be a frame from the video or a similar static shot.

If these files are missing, the hero still shows a graceful blue-tinted
gradient fallback (no broken layout or missing media).
